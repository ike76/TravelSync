# TripSync

**TripSync** aims to simplify travel booking and organization for small groups.  

you can manage your **trips**, which have several **legs**.  Each **leg** is a connection from any point A to B.   (_Flight #7304 from San Francisco airport to Dallas Airport is a_ **leg**)    

Each **leg** can be assigned to whomever of your **travelers** you want.  This way its easy for two people to take a taxi, while the other three people take a shuttle - to the same airport.   
1. Enter the shuttle info
2. Enter the taxi info
3. assign the correct people to each
... and thats it!  The correct plans show up in each persons profile.
