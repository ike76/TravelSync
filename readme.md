# TripSync

**TripSync** aims to simplify travel booking and organization for small groups.  

you can manage your **trips**, which have several **legs**.  Each **leg** is a connection from any point A to B.   (_Flight #7304 from San Francisco airport to Dallas Airport is a_ **leg**)    

Each **leg** can be assigned to whomever of your **travelers** you want.  This way its easy for two people to take a taxi, while the other three people take a shuttle - to the same airport.   Enter the shuttle info, the taxi info, assign the correct people to each and it's all set.  The correct plans show up in each persons profile.
