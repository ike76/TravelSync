# TripSync

**TripSync** aims to simplify travel booking and organization for small groups.  

you can manage your **trips**, each of which have several **legs**.  
Each **leg** is a connection from any point A to B.   (_"Texas Meeting" would be a **trip**,  Flight #7304 from SFO to DFW would be one of its **legs**_)    

Each **leg** can be assigned to whomever of your **travelers** you want.  This way its easy for two people to take a taxi, while the other three people take a shuttle - to the same airport.   
1. Enter the shuttle info
2. Enter the taxi info
3. Assign the correct people to each
... and thats it!  The correct plans automagically show up in each person's profile.
